# Roombelt activity map ðŸ—º

<img src="https://maps.roombelt.com/roombelt.svg" height="300">

This application generates an animated SVG world map with locations of active users of Roombelt. The map is embedded into https://roombelt.com in the "social proof" section to prove that the product has real world usage. You can easily create similar map for your product by following the steps below:

### Prerequisites
1. Star this repository ðŸ˜œ
2. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
3. Get a Redis instance. I use [Upstash](https://www.upstash.com/) but any modern Redis server would do.
