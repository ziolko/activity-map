# Roombelt activity map ðŸ—º

<img src="https://maps.roombelt.com/roombelt.svg" height="300">

This application generates an animated SVG world map with locations of active users of [Roombelt](https://roombelt.com). The map is embedded into https://roombelt.com in the "social proof" section to prove that the product has real world usage. 

You can easily create similar map for your product by following the steps below. If you don't feel like setting this up manually drop me an email at mateusz@roombelt.com. I can create you an account on my instance (https://maps.roombelt.com) for a few $/month.

### Prerequisites
1. Star this repository ðŸ˜œ
2. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
3. Get a Redis instance. I use [Upstash](https://www.upstash.com/) but any modern Redis server would do.

### Installation
1. Create a new Vercel project with the following environment variables:
   * `REDIS_URL`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PORT` that define connection to the Redis database.
   * `TOKEN` is a secret that you will use to POST points to the map.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Deploy this repository to Vercel with Vercel CLI or git.

### Usage 
Single server can serve multiple separate maps. I use only https://maps.roombelt.com/roombelt.svg but other addresses like https://maps.roombelt.com/example.svg or https://maps.roombelt.com/subscribers.svg could be used as well.

Reporting user activity from your back-end is as simple as sending a `POST` request with a valid authorization header and the reported `ip` address in the payload:
```js
await axios.post(
  "https://maps.roombelt.com/roombelt.svg",
  { ip: clientIp },
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env["TOKEN"]}` } }
);
```

If you use this idea on your site let me know and I will add a link here.

### Credits
The idea was inspired by [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/en/) dashboard activity map. The map generation code is based on https://github.com/NTag/dotted-map.
